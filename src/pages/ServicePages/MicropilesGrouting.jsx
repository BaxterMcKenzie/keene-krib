            <p>
              At <strong>Keene Krib</strong>, we provide specialist micropiling
              and injection grouting services to strengthen foundations and
              improve ground stability in difficult soil conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Micropiles</strong> are small-diameter, high-strength
              piles ideal for tight or constrained spaces where traditional
              piling cannot be used.
              <br />
              <strong>Grouting</strong> involves injecting cementitious or
              chemical materials to fill voids, reduce permeability, and enhance
              soil bearing capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              These solutions are perfect for underpinning existing structures,
              stabilizing slopes, and supporting new developments.
              <br />
              We work closely with engineers to design systems that meet your
              site’s geotechnical requirements, delivering long-term stability
              and performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Choosing <strong>Keene Krib</strong> for micropile and grouting
              projects ensures expert installation, durable results, and
              confidence in the safety of your structures.
