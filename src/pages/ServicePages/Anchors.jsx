            <p>
              At <strong>Keene Krib</strong>, we specialize in the professional
              installation of ground anchors for retaining walls, slopes, and
              other unstable terrain across Wellington.
              <br />
              Our anchor solutions include <strong>
                tension anchors
              </strong>, <strong>passive anchors</strong>, and{" "}
              <strong>pile anchors</strong>, all engineered to meet precise load
              and site requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Tension anchors</strong> are designed to pull and hold
              structures securely in place, making them ideal for stabilizing
              steep slopes and retaining walls.
              <br />
              <strong>Passive anchors</strong> provide reinforcement for
              existing structures without additional tensioning, helping to
              maintain long-term stability.
              <br />
              <strong>Pile anchors</strong> deliver strong support for new or
              complex installations, ensuring foundations and walls remain safe
              and durable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our team works closely with engineers and surveyors to design
              anchor systems that maximize stability, comply with local building
              regulations, and extend the lifespan of your structures.
              <br />
              Whether you’re reinforcing an existing retaining wall, securing a
              slope, or installing a new anchor system,{" "}
              <strong>Keene Krib</strong> delivers reliable, high-quality
              solutions tailored to your site’s specific needs.
